function runGame (grid='default', birth=-1, life=-1, startState=-1, numGens=-1, worldName='default', recordInterval = [-1 -1])

  % This program runs, and illustrates, a Game of Life world with user-specified
  % (or default) properties. It makes use of a WHILE-LOOP to:
  %   - draw each generation of the game world via. the spy() function
  %   - compute the state of the generation after the one that has been drawn
  % Game state data is stored in TWO SPARSE MATRICES:
  %   - one, which stores the latest complete data, is used for reference
  %     in drawing and as the basis for computation of a new state
  %   - the other, which stores outdated data, is in the current loop being
  %     overwritten with the new state's data based on said computation
  % These two matrices are switched at one point in each game loop.
  %
  %
  % Input arguments:
  %
  %         grid -- string; Possible values: {'sqr'/'hex'/'tri'}
  %                 - The type of grid the game cells would live on
  %
  %        birth -- integer, or, vector of integers
  %                 - The amount of neighbours of a dead cell required for birth
  %                   i.e. it be given life
  %
  %         life -- integer, or, vector of integers
  %                 - Amount of neighbours required to maintain life
  %                   of an already living cell
  %
  %   startState -- matrix of zeros and non-zeros
  %                 - Represents the life-or-death states of all cells
  %                   at the start of the game; 0 being dead, non-0 being alive
  %
  %      numGens -- integer
  %                 - The number of total generations the game will run
  %
  %
  % Default values (if left empty or set as negative):
