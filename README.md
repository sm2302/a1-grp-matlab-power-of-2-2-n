# About

This branch is just for reference on how we used to write our code.

`runGame.m` is where most of the logic were written, which include generalized procedures for all shapes of grid and variable rules for birth and survival. Because it contains "everything", it is difficult to locate specific parts of the code, which was the reason that in our latest code we distributed plotting and the different grid & rules' step functions into their own files.
