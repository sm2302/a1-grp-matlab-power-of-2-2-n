## Relevant Files' Descriptions

| File | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| solutions.m | The main script where all functions are pieced together to demonstrate their collective result |
| plotGrid.m | The function which handles all plot/figure related procedures, e.g. setting the figure title, aspect ratio, displaying each cell according to its type (e.g. downward pointing or upward pointing triangle), etc |
| **stepFunction** <br /> (folder) | Folder containing all step functions that generally take in a current state `A0` as argument and computes and returns the next state `A1` |
| stepLife.m | The most basic and most concise step function. Refer to this file first in understanding the procedures common in all step functions. |
| stepSquare.m | Almost exactly similar to stepLife, except that it expects 2 additional input arguments, the birth condition and survival condition (vector of numbers of neighbours to cause birth or survival) |
| stepTriangle.m | Like stepLife.m, it has fixed rules (for simplicity), but has two different methods of computing neighbourhood depending on the cell's location in the grid (upward pointing or downward pointing triangle) |
| stepHex.m | Similar to stepLife.m with the exception of its own fixed set of rules (for simplicity) and neighbourhood computation due to its grid shape and coordinates system (refer down below) |
| stepHex3.m | Modification to stepHex.m. Different than the other step functions in that it computes for a world where cells have three different states e.g. dead, blue (alive) and red (alive) instead of 2 (dead and alive). This allows for a more LIFE-like activity pattern, as shown in [animation below](#Square-Grid-Cellular-Automata-with-Different-Rules)|
| getLattice.m | Generates one of two types of checkerboard pattern, i.e., either starting with 1, or starting with 0, of size determined by the `height` and `width` values passed as numeric arguments (along with the single character argument, the lattice `type`) |
